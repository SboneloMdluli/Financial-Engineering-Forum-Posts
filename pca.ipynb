    "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that aims to project data into a lower dimensional space while preserving important properties of the data, such as relative distances between data points. This is similar to other dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE and UMAP. The goal of PCA is to retain as much information about the original high-dimensional data as possible, which is achieved by choosing an orthogonal basis (the principal components) that maximises the variance in the data. This is equivalent to minimising the residuals in the projected subspace. \n",

    "The objective of (PCA) is to project a dataset $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ into a lower dimensional vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ s.t $\\langle\\,v,v\\rangle=\\|v\\| = 1$. The i-th projection is $y_i=\\langle\\, x_i,v\\rangle v$"
